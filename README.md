## Description
The matlabcode of SCQ-SSA. The three main strategies are adopted to strengthen the basic SSA, including chaos theory, sine-cosine mechanism and the principle of quantum
computation.   

## The code structure is as follows:  
initialization.m is the initialization of the original SSA.  
chaosinitialization.m is the initialization with chaos.  
Get_Functions_details_Test.m is the test functions.  
newMain.m is the main function.  
SCQSSA.m is the the main part of SCQ-SSA algorithm, including sine-cosine mechanism and quantum computation.
